# Bioinformatics Scripts

This repository contains bioinformatics scripts for analyzing DNA sequences. The goal is to showcase my skills in Python and bioinformatics.

## Scripts

### 1. `count_nucleotides.py`
- **Purpose**: Counts the number of nucleotides (A, T, C, G) in a DNA sequence provided in a FASTA file.
- **How It Works**:
  - Reads a DNA sequence from a FASTA file.
  - Iterates through the sequence and counts occurrences of each nucleotide.
- **Example FASTA File**: `FTSJ2 Homo sapiens.fasta`, You should use the name of your FASTA file here. 

### 2. `FTSJ2 Homo sapiens.fasta`
- A sample DNA sequence of gene FTSJ2 Homo sapiens in FASTA format to test the script.

## Requirements

To run these scripts, you need the following installed:
- **Python 3.9+**
- **Biopython Library**

### Installation:
To install Biopython, run:
```bash
pip install biopython
